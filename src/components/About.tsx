                    <p>I am a sophomore computer science student at Texas A&M University. My primary interests are the 
                        use of software development in music technology and education.</p>
                    <p>At Texas A&M, I am most involved in Aggie Coding Club, where I have served as a project manager
                        for three semesters. My project, NPCRoom, teaches students about full-stack web development through
                        the creation of an NPC chat room. The project won ACC's Best Learning-Focused Project for Fall 2024.</p>
                    <p>Other organizations I am a part of include Aggie Competitive Programming Club, Texas A&M Computing Society 
                        (Texas A&M's student chapter of the Assocation for Computing Machinery), and the National Society of Black Engineers.</p>
                    <p>I love helping other people out, as is evident through the several software-based projects I have worked on (click Projects for more information)
                        as well as my teaching-related positions. I was a peer teacher for the Engineering Computation Lab
                        course (ENGR 102) at Texas A&M and will be a TA for the data structures course (CSCE 221)
                        in Spring 2025. I also work as a Help Session Tutor for calculus 3 (MATH 251) for Texas A&M's Math Learning Center.
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of computer science, I enjoy music and Pok√©mon. I am a member of the Texas A&M University Trombone Choir and
                        compose in my free time.
